//Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
//Use at least one array.
//Use at least two classes.
//Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

//Menu will be for a chorus. The first class will be for the singers, with their name and their tenure as constructors. The next class will be the vocal secttions those singers are part of-here I'll add an empty array called singers.

class Singer {
    constructor(name, tenure){
    this.name = name;
    this.tenure = tenure;
    }//Now I'll add a method to desribe this info about the singers:
    describe(){
        return `${this.name} has been a member of the chorus for ${this.tenure}`;
    }
}

class Vocals {
    constructor(part){
        this.part = part;

    }//function to add singers to Vocal part if they're part of Singer class and an error msg if they're not:

            return `The ${this.part} section has ${this.singers.length} singers.`;
